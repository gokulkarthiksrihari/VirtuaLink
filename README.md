## Tech Stacks Used

The project utilizes the following tech stacks:

1. **Agora** - Agora provides the voice chat and video chat functionality for real-time communication within the application. It enables seamless audio and video streaming between users.

2. **Photon PUN 2** - Photon PUN 2 is a networking framework for Unity that facilitates multiplayer functionality. It allows multiple users to interact and collaborate within the virtual environment.

3. **Railway** - Railway is a token server used for authentication purposes. It provides secure token generation and validation to ensure authorized access to the collaborative sessions.

4. **Inbuilt Web Browser** - The project integrates an inbuilt web browser feature to enable users to browse web content within the application. It enhances the immersive experience by allowing access to relevant web resources.


## Features

The Unity project offers the following key features:

1. **Video Calling**: Participants can engage in real-time video calls, fostering face-to-face interactions and enhancing the collaborative experience.

2. **Chat**: The application includes a chat feature, enabling text-based communication among participants. Users can exchange messages, share ideas, and collaborate effectively.

3. **Screen Sharing**: Participants have the ability to share their screens, allowing them to present content, showcase their work, or collaborate on specific tasks.

4. **Inbuilt Browser**: The integrated web browser provides users with the ability to browse web content without leaving the application. It facilitates access to relevant information and resources during collaborative sessions.

5. **Attractive Environment**: The project provides an immersive and visually appealing environment that enhances the collaborative experience, making sessions more engaging and enjoyable.

6. **Multiple User Support**: Users can join collaborative sessions and interact with other participants in real time, fostering collaboration and communication.


## System Requirements (Windows)

To run the Unity project on Windows, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 (64-bit)
- Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- Graphics Card: DirectX 11 compatible with at least 2 GB VRAM
- Storage: 10 GB available space
- Network: Broadband internet connection

## Network Requirements

For optimal performance and functionality, the Unity project requires a stable network connection with the following specifications:

- Internet Connection: Broadband or high-speed internet connection
- Network Latency: Low latency is recommended for real-time communication and synchronization between users
- Bandwidth: Sufficient bandwidth to support video streaming, voice chat, and other real-time communication features

Please ensure that your network configuration meets these requirements for a smooth and immersive online collaborative experience.


## Limitations

The project has some limitations in the following tech stacks:

1. **Agora** - Agora provides the voice chat and video chat functionality for real-time communication within the application. It enables seamless audio and video streaming between users. However, some limitations include:
   - Scalability may be limited depending on the number of concurrent users and available network bandwidth.
   - Performance may vary depending on internet connection quality and device capabilities.
   - Pricing structure may have limitations for larger-scale deployments or specific usage scenarios.

2. **Photon PUN 2** - Photon PUN 2 is a networking framework for Unity that facilitates multiplayer functionality. It allows multiple users to interact and collaborate within the virtual environment. However, there are a few limitations to consider:
   - Scalability and number of concurrent users may be subject to the Photon plan being used.
   - Performance and reliability can be affected by network latency and user distribution.
   - The free plan has limitations on concurrent users and certain features.

3. **Railway** - Railway is a token server used for authentication purposes. It provides secure token generation and validation. However, there are a few limitations to be aware of:
   - Scalability may be limited depending on the number of simultaneous connections.
   - The free plan has limitations on requests and certain advanced features.
   - Token generation and validation may introduce additional latency.

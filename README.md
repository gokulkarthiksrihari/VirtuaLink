- Network Latency: Low latency is recommended for real-time communication and synchronization between users
- Bandwidth: Sufficient bandwidth to support video streaming, voice chat, and other real-time communication features

Please ensure that your network configuration meets these requirements for a smooth and immersive online collaborative experience.


## Limitations

The project has some limitations in the following tech stacks:

1. **Agora** - Agora provides the voice chat and video chat functionality for real-time communication within the application. It enables seamless audio and video streaming between users. However, some limitations include:
   - Scalability may be limited depending on the number of concurrent users and available network bandwidth.
   - Performance may vary depending on internet connection quality and device capabilities.
   - Pricing structure may have limitations for larger-scale deployments or specific usage scenarios.

2. **Photon PUN 2** - Photon PUN 2 is a networking framework for Unity that facilitates multiplayer functionality. It allows multiple users to interact and collaborate within the virtual environment. However, there are a few limitations to consider:
   - Scalability and number of concurrent users may be subject to the Photon plan being used.
   - Performance and reliability can be affected by network latency and user distribution.
   - The free plan has limitations on concurrent users and certain features.

3. **Railway** - Railway is a token server used for authentication purposes. It provides secure token generation and validation. However, there are a few limitations to be aware of:
   - Scalability may be limited depending on the number of simultaneous connections.
   - The free plan has limitations on requests and certain advanced features.
   - Token generation and validation may introduce additional latency.
